### Overview

As of this writing, none of Skylar's public-facing sites or services store, upload, or process any personal data — except where noted (like the guestbook), identifying or otherwise. There's no tracking, no analytics, and no cookie banners. You just get the content, nothing else.

That said, there's now a [guestbook](/guestbook). If you leave a message there, some personal data might be stored (see below).

### What Counts as "Personal Data"

"Personal data" means anything that could be used to identify you, like your name, IP address, location, or anything else tied to your identity. If you want the full legal breakdown, check out the [GDPR's definition here](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/).

### Guestbook Submissions

If you use the [guestbook](/guestbook), you're submitting a **name** and a **message**. These are stored so others can see them, obviously. Don't put anything sensitive in there, treat it like a public shout-out.

- Messages are public once submitted. You can contact me if you'd like yours removed.
- No hidden tracking, profiling, or fingerprinting.
- The form uses [Cloudflare Turnstile] to block spam. Turnstile may process some data (e.g. your IP or browser info, I don't see that data — it's between you and Cloudflare) to verify you're human. You can read more in [Cloudflare's Turnstile Privacy Addendum](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/turnstile-privacy-policy/).

### Cloudflare & Hosting

All of Skylar's web services are hosted on a Hetzner Cloud server located in Helsinki, Finland. That said, they're still fronted by Cloudflare for protection (firewalls, rate limiting, DDoS shielding, etc.).

While no data is collected intentionally by Skylar, Cloudflare may still process some basic connection metadata as part of their infrastructure (like IPs and request logs).

You can read more about what Cloudflare does with that info in their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/).

### Scope

These terms apply to any domains or apps listed on the [Domain list](/domains). If there are exceptions (e.g., services that do log or store data), those will be clearly noted on the relevant domain or app itself.

### Contact

If anything's unclear, or if you have questions about how stuff works, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to chat.
