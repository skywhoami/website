### Overview

As of this writing, none of Skylar's public-facing sites or services store, upload, or process any personal data, identifying or otherwise. There's no tracking, no analytics, and no cookie banners. You just get the content, nothing else.

### What Counts as "Personal Data"

"Personal data" means anything that could be used to identify you, like your name, IP address, location, or anything else tied to your identity. If you want the full legal breakdown, check out the [GDPR's definition here](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/).

### Hosting

All of Skylar's services are hosted on OVH servers located in London, United Kingdom.

While no data is collected intentionally by Skylar, OVH may still process some basic connection metadata as part of their infrastructure (like IPs and request logs).

### Scope

These terms apply to any domains or apps listed on the [Domain list](/domains). If there are exceptions (e.g., services that do log or store data), those will be clearly noted on the relevant domain or app itself.

### Contact

If anything's unclear, or if you have questions about how stuff works, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to chat.
